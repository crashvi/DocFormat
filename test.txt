1  Introduction 
Digital  signal  processing  technology,  as  an  important product of the information age, exists in all aspects of the communication field and is an indispensable technology in  the  communication field. In recent  years,  China  has increased its support for chips. Therefore, it has promoted the development and promotion of DSP chips, making it a  control  chip  for  many  mainstream  software communication products. In the field of communications, the  equipment  that  applies  digital  signal  processing mainly  includes  systems  such  as  telephone communications, video voice, and voice signals, which effectively  promote  information  exchange  and information  sharing.  In  the  field  of  communication, digital signal processing technology is mainly applied to speech compression coding and software radio. Of course, there are still problems such as signal quality and signal transmission speed that need to be resolved. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, it is necessary to continue in-depth research on digital signal technology based on the  current  research  results  and  promote  the  healthy development of the communication industry.
